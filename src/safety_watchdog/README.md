## Description
This package contains two entry points:
1. [`safety_gate_robot`](./safety_watchdog/safety_gate_robot.py): Implementation of the safety status-based velocity regulation pass-through node for a UR5 robot. Based on the status of the [`red_button`](../safety_monitor/safety_monitor/red_button.py) and the current [`proximity_status`](../safety_monitor/safety_monitor/proximity_sensor.py), the gate slows-down, speeds-up, or stops the robot operation. This node is packed with the [`config_robot.py`](./safety_watchdog/config_robot.py) which specifies the communication topics

2. [`safety_gate_turtle`](./safety_watchdog/safety_gate_turtle.py): Implementation of the safety status-based velocity regulation pass-through node for a turtlebot. Based on the status of the [`red_button`](../safety_monitor/safety_monitor/red_button.py) and the current [`proximity_status`](../safety_monitor/safety_monitor/proximity_sensor.py), the gate slows-down, speeds-up, or stops the robot operation. Further reasoning for the purpose of this node is provided in the [main README file](../../README.md#L90). This node is packed with the [`config_turtle.py`](./safety_watchdog/config_turtle.py) which specifies the communication topics; and a [`translators_turtle.py`](./safety_watchdog/translators_turtle.py) which defines translator functions specific to this entry point. These additional files are intended as requirement indicators in case the `safety_gate` node is meant to be used with another robot/application.
